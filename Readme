Here we present some MATLAB code accompanying the paper “Nash Social Distancing Games with Equity Constraints: How Inequality Aversion Affects the Spread of Epidemics”.
Functions and Scripts
For a full set of files please download codeNew.zip
Initialization: Defines the parameters of the model 
Nash_eq: Finds the unconstrained Nash equilibria 
script_1: Computes the values of J1 and J2 on a grid of points. Computes also the partial derivatives of J_1,J_2 with respect to u_1 and u_2
equ_comp: Finds the set of pairs of points (u_1,u_2) that satisfy the conditions of Proposition 4.(iv)
gk_computation: Computs function g^K_{j\mu_1,mu_2)(u)
gL_computation: Computs function g^L_{j\mu_1,mu_2)(u)
find_eq_V_C: Finds a set of GNE under the constraint V<=C, given C
plotting_costs_wrt_C: Finds a set of GNE under the constraint V<=C, for several C
drawVfields: Draws the vector fields (see Example 3)
ode_F_randomizing: The right-hand side of the differential equation of Section 3 (players randomize between u_m and u_M
odefcn: The right-hand side of the differential equation where all players use deterministic strategies (u_1,u_2)
odefcn1: The right-hand side of the differential equation where all players use deterministic strategies (u_1,u_2), except some who deviate. It represent the coupled differential equation with the linearized system and the DE of the deviators.

To run an example, begin with Initialization.m, giving the desired parameters. This will provide also the Nash equilibrium of the unconstrained game. Then, run script_1.m and equ_comp.m to find the points where condition (iv) of Proposition 4 is satisfied. For given C, run find_eq_V_C.m to find the set of GNE. Finally, run plotting_costs_wrt_C.m to find the GNE, for several C. This script also computes the optimal GNE, for each given C and the bargaining solution.
